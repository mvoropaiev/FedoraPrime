Fedora Prime
============

A collection of shell scripts that makes it possible to use the NVIDIA GPU on a Optimus Laptop. The switching
is similar to the feature provided by the nvidia-prime package in Ubuntu. However, no such package has been
made for other distributions. This is exactly the functionality this package provide.

Background
----------

In 2012, Linus Torvalds gave his famous talk at the University of Helsinki where he gave NVIDIA the middle finger
due to lack of support of, in particular, device drivers for the optimus laptop. Not long after NVIDIA provided
both documentation for developers of the nouveau project (an open-source implementation of the NVIDIA drivers)
and partially support for switching between the Intel and NVIDIA drivers. Canonical then began working on their
nvidia-prime package that should make the switching simple, basically just providing one command `prime-select`
for switching, taking either `nvidia` or `intel` as parameter. The downside is that you need to logout for the
switching to happen. The same limitations are there for this package.

Features
--------

The package provide just one script, fedora-prime-select that will select either NVIDIA or Intel GPU, just run:

    # fedora-prime-select nvidia|intel

and logout/login, voila you are using the requested driver.

Usage
-----

On Fedora 22 (probably also 23) install the `akmod-nvidia` package from rpmfusion repository. Make sure the
kernel module is compiled. Backup the following files (will be deleted by fedora-prime-select): `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`,
`/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-nvidia.conf`, and `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/nvidia-lib64.conf`.

* Install the RPM package, use my COPR repository:
  ```sh
  dnf copr enable bosim/fedora-prime
  dnf install fedora-prime-select
  ```
* Use manual `setup.sh` script (run as root):
  ```sh
  # install or update fedora-prime files:
  ./setup.sh install
  # remove fedora-prime from system:
  ./setup.sh uninstall
  ```


Edit `/etc/fedora-prime/xorg.nvidia.conf` and add the right `BusID` (mine was `4:0:0`, yours is probably something
else. Find it using `lspci`). Restart. When you login you can run `fedora-prime-select nvidia` and then logout/login
and you will be using the NVIDIA GPU. Since the way of switching GPU does not play well with GDM we will use the
Intel GPU are every reboot.

Known bugs
----------

* If you are using Fedora 23 with `xorg-x11-server` version `1.18.0-2.fc23` there is [known bug](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92313) which result in corrupted menus and undetectable screen resolution in `nvidia-settings`. Temporay workaround is to downgrade `xorg-x11-server` package to the one from Fedora 22 repository:
  ```sh
  # downgrade package(s):
  dnf --allowerasing --releasever=22 downgrade xorg-x11-server-Xorg
  # prevent upgrade for xorg-x11* stack:
  echo 'exclude=xorg-x11*' >> /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
  ```
**Note:** remember to remove restriction and do a system update when the fix will be available.

* If you are in Intel mode and your system has been suspended, changing to NVIDIA may result in blank screen. Therefore
you may need to reboot your machine. This is due to limitations of gdm (Ubuntu has patched gdm to run a script similar to
`xinitrc.nvidia`, but these changes are not available upstream, thanks Ubuntu). We set the intel card active during reboot,
so we should always be able to recover from the blackscreen by rebooting.

TODO
----

* BusID detection for `xorg.nvidia.conf`
